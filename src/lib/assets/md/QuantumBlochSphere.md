## The Bloch-sphere

As the coefficients $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are complex numbers, they can be expressed in the form $\alpha = \Vert{\alpha}\Vert \cdot e^{i \phi_{\alpha}}$ and $\beta = \Vert{\beta}\Vert \cdot e^{i \phi_{\beta}}$. Thus, the state of the qubit can be rewritten as $\Vert{\alpha}\Vert \cdot e^{i \phi_{\alpha}} |0\rangle + \Vert{\beta}\Vert \cdot e^{i \phi_{\beta}} |1\rangle$.

Remember that $e^{i \phi_{\alpha}}$ is a unit vector rotated around the origin, and therefore the square of its norm $\Vert{e^{i \phi_{\alpha}}}\Vert^2$ also equals to $1$. This means that we can modify the angles $\phi_{\alpha}$ and $\phi_{\beta}$ freely without affecting the measurement probabilities. Therefore, we can do an algebraic trick to simplify the expression above. Namely, let's divide the state by $e^{i \phi_{\alpha}}$ to obtain $\Vert{\alpha}\Vert \cdot |0\rangle + \Vert{\beta}\Vert \cdot \frac{e^{i \phi_{\beta}}}{e^{i \phi_{\alpha}}} |1\rangle$. By the rules of exponentiation, $\frac{e^{i \phi_{\beta}}}{e^{i \phi_{\alpha}}} = e^{i (\phi_{\beta} - \phi_{\alpha})}$. Next, let's introduce a new variable $\phi = \phi_{\beta} - \phi_{\alpha}$, with the help of which the state can be further simplified to $\Vert{\alpha}\Vert \cdot |0\rangle + \Vert{\beta}\Vert \cdot e^{i \phi} |1\rangle$.

We know that $\Vert{\alpha}\Vert^2 + \Vert{\beta}\Vert^2 = 1$. Consequently, these two numbers can also be represented geometrically as vector of unit length rotated around the origin by some angle, the *double* of which we'll denote as $\theta$. Using trigonometry, we can now rewrite the state as $\cos{(\frac{\theta}{2})} \cdot |0 \rangle + \sin{(\frac{\theta}{2})} \cdot e^{i \phi} |1 \rangle$. Notice, that we now only need two variables to express the state of the qubit: the angles $\theta$ and $\phi$. Geometrically, this can be represented as a vector pointing to the surface of 3-dimensional sphere with unit radius, where $\theta$ is the angle of the vector and the $z$ axis, and $\phi$ is the angle of the vertical projection of the vector on the $x-y$ plane. This representation of qubit states is called the *Bloch sphere*.

It's important to note that of the two degrees of freedom on the Bloch sphere, only the angle $\theta$ is related to measurement probabilities. $\phi$ is an inherently quantum property called the *phase* that does not have physical manifestation directly observable to us. Because of this, it's hard to find any intuitive analogy from everyday life that could help us understand what exactly the phase is. The most useful approach in this context is to look at the phase as a matematical property of quantum objects that we can leverage to design clever algorithms.
