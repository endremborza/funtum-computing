## Quantum gates

{{Quantum operators|wiki:Operator_(physics)}} are functions that act on the state of a quantum system. Quantum algorithms are sequences of specific quantum operators that modify the state of single or multiple qubits. The physical device that implements quantum algorithms is called a {{quantum circuit|wiki:Quantum_circuit}}, the building blocks of which are {{quantum logic gates|wiki:Quantum_logic_gate}} that correspond to the individual operators in the sequence.

For each quantum operator, there's a corresponding matrix and the state of the qubit can be written as a vector $|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix}\alpha\\\beta\end{bmatrix},$ so the algebraic representation of an operator $U$ acting on the state $|\psi\rangle$ is essentially the matrix multiplication $U|\psi\rangle$. For example, the Hadamard gate is represented by the $\displaystyle H = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}1&1 \\ 1&-1\end{bmatrix}$ matrix, which means it can transform a qubit from a state of $\begin{bmatrix}1+0i\\0+0i\end{bmatrix}$ to $\begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}+0i\\\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}+0i\end{bmatrix}$. This is a slightly more complicated case of [thinking of matrices as linear transformations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYB8IZa5AuE) - as complex numbers are involved - but the basic principles remain the same, and hopefully one can gather a decent understanding by tinkering with the Bloch sphere and its transformations below.
